This git repository contains all the scripts used in the scope of the assignment of Numerical Analysis of Civil Engineering Structures.

The last push is only the add of all the Abaqus files that were saved on Candix computers.

## Instructions

All the python scripts have to be launched from the main folder of the repository.

The Abaqus files part_1_bonus/euler.cae, part_1_bonus/timo.cae and part_2/a/a.cae are from the 2024 version while part_2/b/b_2d.cae, part_2/c/c_3d.cae, part_2/e/e_3d.cae are from the 2021 version.

The Abaqus file for b_3D was not saved and re-used for c_3D. The abaqus file for d_3D was an adaptation of c_3D and re-used for e_3D, it was not saved.
